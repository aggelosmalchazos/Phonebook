# phonebook
A very simple and basic implementation of a phonebook using an array to store all the data.
Each person has a first name, last name, address, and telephone number.
Basic functions include:
-Add a person in the phonebook
-Search a person in the phonebook, either by name or telephone number
-Modify the person's first and last name, or telephone number.
-Delete the entry of a person.

Deletion works by switching the position we wish to delete with the last position, and then decreasing the count pointer.
